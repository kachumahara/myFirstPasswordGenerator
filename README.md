## PasswordGenerator

Instruction is to build a Random Password Generator. 

Struggles and Successes

I almost missed that the password length was beetween 8 and 128 characters, because in my own notes I had put between 6 and 128 characters!

I was originally taking the easy way out on the special characters front. On last inspection of the instructional ReadMe I noticed that we needed to include a more robust selection. Through researching I found what necessary slashes would need to be inserted so that certain characters would not completely break my string. 
It was a challenging task, was able to get some functions working and my instructor corrected some errors.
